<h1>Astarte's Reading Response</h1>

<p>I feel as though it’s an interesting analysis to perceive the internet as a single point at the center of the globe. 
    I understand his examination of the internet being the one thing we all share as humans and after viewing the art work
     it does make sense to interpret it in this manner but he goes on to mention how internet is different in varying places 
     like China, Morocco etc. I would say, technically we aren’t sharing the same internet. So far though, I would agree with
      his structural diagrams being an accurate representation of the internet.

    <br>
    <br>

    He moves on to describe another diagram that includes cyber space which generically I can understand but mapping out 
    such an intricate process of systems can be difficult and putting it into such simple terms seems like it’s missing 
    something. It feels like he’s trying to create a mathematical equation with the internet and search engines and I never
    liked math. 

    <br>
    
    There was an interesting quote mentioned in the article that stuck with me, “Everything is potentially one click away: 
    I.e. both close and far at the same time.” I thought this was a compelling way to make the point that distance isn’t 
    relevant on the Internet.

    <br>
    
    I find it interesting that the US has a dominant position on the Net, this is something 
    I wasn’t aware of. I also like the way he described the internet as a force that compels you 
    to wander. Like a slope that one will almost Inevitable slide down. This was my favorite section. 
    I feel the author accurately described what it’s like to be an average web surfer today.

    <br>
    
    I’ve always been quite intrigued by the deep web and could never quite fathom the idea that we haven’t
     explored almost 70% of it. How is that possible? What is this the ocean? We created the internet and 
     somehow its contents escaped the creators own understanding?? Does’t make sense to me but I’m definitely curious.

     <br>
    
    The author ends the article explaining how our internet experience is personalized to us. They also stated how the 
    Internet tracks everything like locations, conversations etc. It makes me wish there was a way to use the internet 
    and still stay private but it almost feels impossible in a world where computers are slowly beginning to take over. 
    At least we’re all fucked as a group if anything were to ever go wrong.
